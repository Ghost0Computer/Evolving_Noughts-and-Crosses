# Evolving_Noughts-and-Crosses
What started as a normal game of Noughts &amp; Crosses (TicTacToe / Xs and Os) is now unrecognisable. 
I have gotten people to suggest changes and I simply add them to the game.
My current favourite addition I have implemented: The ability to move the board around with moving the Noughts or Crosses.

Each version contains a README, make sure to read it.
New features and rules explained in READMEs.
